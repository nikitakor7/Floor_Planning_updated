The program is divided into two arts namely HardBlocks and Soft blocks

1) Main. cpp

This is the main file of the project and calls all the necessary files to perform operation

2)Project_1.cpp
This file is the parser file. Implies it reads the text files given by the user and extracts necessary parameters

3)generate_polish.cpp
This file generates a random infix polish expression given the no of elements present

4)polish_final.cpp
This file generates a postfix polish expression given the infix polish expression

5)area123.cpp
This file calculates the area of the given polish expression

6)moves.cpp
Generates necessary moves for simulated annealing

7)simulated_annealing.cpp
This file applies simulated annealing algorithm to the given polish expression and finds the best possible string with minimum costfunction

8)soft_computation.cpp
This file generates length and height parameters

9)vertical_slicing.cpp
This file performs vertical slicing and generates suitable (length, Height) pairs

9)horizontal_slicing.cpp
This file performs horizontal slicing and generates suitable (length, Height) pairs

10)trace.cpp
This file back traces to find coordinates

11)Area_optimum
This file decides which W&L to choose to find the optimum area
